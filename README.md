Description
This program is a simple contract written in Remix ide in solidity, a programming language used for developing smart contracts on the  blockchain. The contract has a use of functions such as require() assert() and revert () This program serves as a simple and straightforward introduction to Solidity programming, and can be used as a stepping stone for more complex projects in the future.


Functionality :-
Contract successfully uses require() - require function = The require function plays a pivotal role in developing secure and reliable Solidity contracts. 
Contract successfully uses assert() - assert function = The assert function is used to check for internal errors in the contract code. It takes a boolean expression as its argument and throws an exception and reverts the transaction if the expression evaluates to false.
Contract successfully uses revert() statements = The revert function is similar to the require function in that it’s used to revert a transaction if a condition is not met.
